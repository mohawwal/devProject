      In my final semester studying{" "}
      <span className="text-[#aaa]">
        Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering
      </span>
      , I started questioning what life after school would look like. While
      juggling exams and research, I explored other interests, from art to
      YouTube and content creation.

      One day, I accidentally clicked on a{" "}
      <span className="text-[#aaa]">JavaScript tutorial</span> video on YouTube
      while searching for how to "make better YT content". I got curious & kept
      watching & that curiosity quickly turned into passion. I taught myself
      HTML, CSS, & JavaScript, and once I found React, I was all in.

      I began a <span className="text-[#aaa]">100 Days of Code</span> challenge
      on Twitter. Right before exams, someone asked me to build an NFT website.
      I took it on, built it with React, and delivered my best.

      That semester, I graduated with a{" "}
      <span className="text-[#aaa]">
        5.0 CGPA, a distinction in my final project

      , and my first real gig. Thatâ€™s when I knew this is what I want to do.

      I've since worked on fintech and e-commerce projects as a full-stack
