  ORIGIN STORY
</p>
<div className="max-w-3xl pt-3 pb-6 text-start font-normal text-[#777] text-sm leading-relaxed space-y-3">
  <p>
    In my final semester studying <span className="text-[#aaa]">Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</span>, 
    I started questioning what life after school would look like. While juggling exams and research, I explored 
    other interests, from art to YouTube and content creation.
  </p>
  <p>
    One day, I clicked on a <span className="text-[#aaa]">JavaScript tutorial</span> by accident while watching 
    a video on making better YouTube content. That curiosity turned into passion. I taught myself HTML, CSS, 
    and JavaScript, and once I found React, I was all in.
  </p>
  <p>
    I began a <span className="text-[#aaa]">100 Days of Code</span> challenge on Twitter. Right before exams, 
    someone asked me to build an NFT website. I took it on, built it with React, and delivered my best.
  </p>
  <p>
    That semester, I graduated with a <span className="text-[#aaa]">5.0 CGPA, a distinction in my final project</span>, 
    and my first real gig. Thatâ€™s when I knew this is what I want to do.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've since worked on fintech and e-commerce projects as a full-stack engineer, using 
    <span className="text-[#aaa]"> React, Vue, React Native, Node.js, Tailwind, and even AI</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span className="text-[#aaa]">This portfolio?</span> I built it fullstack with an admin dashboard to upload projects and track 
    visits by country.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span className="text-[#aaa]">I'm open to new opportunities</span> and always learning one line of code at a time.
